This installation script is interactive. You can choose to add extra packages alongside the 30 Required Arch Packages and 2 Required AUR packages. You also get options to install additional wallpapers (very large collection, 300+ wallpapers). By default, the Dotfiles repository is approximately 1.6 Gigabytes in size.
