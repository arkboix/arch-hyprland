#+TITLE: Arkboi's Arch + Hyprland Dotfiles Installation Script
#+AUTHOR: Arkboi
#+SUBTITLE: A script to install and configure Arkboi's Hyprland dotfiles on Arch Linux.
#+STARTUP: overview

* Introduction
This script automates the installation and setup of Arkboi's Hyprland dotfiles on Arch Linux.
It installs essential packages, backs up existing configurations, cleans up old dotfiles,
clones the latest dotfiles repository, and applies the necessary settings.

* Features
- Installs essential Arch Linux and AUR packages.
- Backs up existing dotfiles before replacing them.
- Clones the latest dotfiles from the GitHub repository.
- Uses GNU Stow to manage dotfiles symlinks.
- Applies wallpaper and color schemes.
- Provides an optional reboot prompt after installation.

* Prerequisites
- A fresh Arch Linux installation with internet access.
- `sudo` privileges.
- Git installed (`sudo pacman -S git` if not installed).

* Installation
1. Clone the script repository:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   git clone https://github.com/arkboix/arch-hyprland.git ~/arch-hyprland
   cd ~/arch-hyprland
   #+END_SRC

2. Make the script executable:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   chmod +x install.sh
   #+END_SRC

3. Run the script:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   ./install.sh
   #+END_SRC

* What the Script Does
- **Asks for sudo password** to avoid repeated prompts.
- **Installs dependencies** (both from the official repo and AUR).
- **Backs up existing configurations** before making any changes.
- **Cleans up old dotfiles** to avoid conflicts.
- **Clones the latest dotfiles** from the repository.
- **Uses GNU Stow** to create symbolic links for dotfiles.
- **Sets up wallpaper and color schemes** using `swww` and `wal.sh`.
- **Provides a reboot option** for finalizing the setup.

* Customization
- Modify the `PACKAGES` and `AUR_PACKAGES` arrays in the script to adjust installed software.
- Change the `FILES` array in the backup section to include additional directories.
- Edit the wallpaper path in the `post_install` section if needed.

* Troubleshooting
- If the script fails due to missing dependencies, manually install them using:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sudo pacman -S --needed stow git curl
  #+END_SRC
- If an AUR package fails, try installing it manually using `yay` or `paru`.
- If `swww` doesn't set the wallpaper, ensure the `swww-daemon` is running.
